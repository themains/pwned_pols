## (O)wned Politicians

Compromised elites are a bit of a problem. To get at the issue, we check how many politicians' online accounts have been breached? We query emails of Indian MPs (Lok Sabha members) against the HIBP database. We find that on average politicians' accounts opened with the listed emails are part of ~ 1 breach. 64\% of the politicans in each Lok Sabha session have had at least 1 account breached.
