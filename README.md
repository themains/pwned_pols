## (O)wned Politicians

How many politicians' online accounts have been breached? We shed light on the question by querying emails of Lok Sabha members against the HIBP API. We find that on average politicians' accounts (opened with the emails) are part of ~ 1 breach. 64\% of the politicans in each Lok Sabha session have been part of at least 1 breach.
