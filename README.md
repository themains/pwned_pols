## (O)wned Politicians

How many politicians' emails have been part of leaks? We shed light on the question by querying emails of Lok Sabha members against the HIBP data. We find that politicians' accounts (opened with the emails) are part of ~ 1 breach with about 64\% of the politicans in each Lok Sabha session having email as part of at least 1 breach.
